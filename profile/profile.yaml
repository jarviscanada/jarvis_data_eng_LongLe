summary: I graduated with a Computer Science Technology DEC (a 3-year college diploma in Montreal) in Vanier College. I'm originally an international student from Vietnam, coming to Montreal for College. Like many other computer science students, I have had a lot of passion about video games since I were young. I have also been really curios in learning about how things work and interact with each other. Moreover, I really loves math. Nothing can describe the satisfaction when you are stuck on a problem for hours, and suddenly, you understand the solution and are able to solve it. Maybe this is the reason why I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science.

    description: Developed 2 SQL queries to create tables in the database (if they haven't exist yet) and inserted some sample values to test them. Then I coded 3 bash scripts. Two bash scripts are able to capture system hardware specifications, and resource usage into the database.  The other bash script is used to create a PostgreSQL database docker container.

summary:  Since I was young, I have always been fascinated in learning about how things work and interact with each others. I love science (physics,chemistry, biology, math, etc) in general. But like many other people, I also love playing video games, so I was very interested in Coding. I decided move halfway across the world, from Vietnam to Canada, to pursue a DEC (Diplôme d'études collégiales - Diploma of College Studies) in Computer Science Technology at Vanier College in Montreal, Quecbec. I'm passionate in learning new technology, and solving logical problems. Nothing can describe the satisfaction when you are stuck on a problem for hours, and suddenly, you understand the solution and are able to solve it. Maybe this is the reason why I love Computer Science. Currently, I'm also interested in learning about Machine Learning, Cloud Computing/Platform, and AI. I would love to learn more about them if I have the chance to.

    description: Designed and coded an application with a classmate as a final project for an E-Commerce class in college. I was responsible for the front end, some back end feature, and database developer. The application stores all products, users information in a database using SQLite. The front end is created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. The app can also make HTTP requests using XAMPP.

    description: Designed an application that display locations where crimes happened in the current week, current month, or current year in a radius of 200 meters, 1 km or the entire Montreal. I used the csv file that contains crime information on the Government of Quebec website, set up a script that automatically update that file everyday, and store the information in a list of objects. This application uses Google Map API to set up pointers based on the filters that the user chooses.
