# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I graduated with a Computer Science Technology DEC (a 3-year college diploma in Montreal) in Vanier College. I'm originally an international student from Vietnam, coming to Montreal for College. Like many other computer science students, I have had a lot of passion about video games since I were young. I have also been really curios in learning about how things work and interact with each other. Moreover, I really loves math. Nothing can describe the satisfaction when you are stuck on a problem for hours, and suddenly, you understand the solution and are able to solve it. Maybe this is the reason why I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science.

    description: Developed 2 SQL queries to create tables in the database (if they haven't exist yet) and inserted some sample values to test them. Then I coded 3 bash scripts. Two bash scripts are able to capture system hardware specifications, and resource usage into the database.  The other bash script is used to create a PostgreSQL database docker container.
